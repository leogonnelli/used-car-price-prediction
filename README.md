# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the price of used cars based on structured datasets. Multiple models were trained and compared, with a final blended model selected for submission.

This is a machine learning project that I had to do in the context of a "Business Analytics and Data Science" course. The goal of this project was to train 3 different models on a train.csv dataset, tune one of them and submit the final model on a private Kaggle competition (class competition) to see who's model would perform the best on unseen data (test.csv, on which the target - price - is not specified). 

The fine-tuned Random Forest Regressor was retained for the Kaggle submission.
